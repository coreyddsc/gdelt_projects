      "Your changes have been saved  Email is sent Email has already been sent Please verify your email address. You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics. This article contains spoilers from One Piece's Elbaf Arc. One Piece chapter 1130 proved to be absolutely stunning from start to finish and it is safe to say that this chapter shocked the fans to quite an extent with the reveal of Loki so early into the arc. Truly, few were expecting Loki to be revealed in such fashion in One Piece chapter 1130, and at the same time, even fewer individuals were expecting him to be as important as he has proven to be. Loki is perhaps the most powerful giant. His strength might be on par with a Yonko in One Piece. In this chapter, fans even got what can be considered to be a buildup of sorts towards a fight between Luffy, who is the Sun God Nika, and Loki, who also believes himself to be the Sun God. It looks like there is going to be a clash of Sun Gods after One Piece chapter 1130 and it is certainly going to be one worth watching, provided Loki does break free from his chains. Luffy and Loki met for the very first time in One Piece chapter 1130. This is a meeting that fans have been anticipating since the Elbaf arc began, but few had imagined it to happen so early. As soon as Luffy found his way into the real Elbaf, the story saw him exploring the country. But, while the forest was certainly intriguing enough for Luffy, something that kept bothering him was a very strong presence nearby. This presence was so strong that Luffy's entire body was tingling. This just goes to show how strong Loki truly is. Along with Luffy, both Zoro and Sanji also felt Loki's presence, and at this point, it was clear for the fans to see that Loki was portrayed to be a monster by Oda. I'm the Sun God who will destroy this world, Loki! – Loki Luffy separated from the crew and went to see Loki by himself, which is where the first meeting finally happened. This was a meeting that fans had waited years for, and finally, the Straw Hat pirate, who is now a Yonko, stood in front of Loki, the Disgraced Prince of Elbaf. Finally, fans got a proper look at Loki's character design, and it is safe to say that this has to be one of One Piece's very best that Oda has delivered so far. Loki looks quite like a mixture of Kaido, Doflamingo, and Katakuri, and just the character design itself personifies the strength of the highest tier. Loki looks Like an absolute monster, and fans cannot wait to see him in real combat. As far as his personality goes, he seems quite brash, but at the same time, prideful, which is expected of a warrior from the land of Elbaf. At the same time, Loki also looks incredibly strong and confident in his abilities, given that he referred to himself as the Sun God, and the one who will destroy the world. Naturally, there is more to Loki than meets the eye, and fans will slowly find out more about him with time. The most interesting thing that fans saw in One Piece chapter 1130 related to Loki was the fact that he called himself the Sun God. As fans know, the Sun God is a deity that is respected and worshiped in Elbaf. In the previous chapter, Road portrayed himself as the Sun God as well. Now, Loki believes himself to be the Sun God. This leads one to believe that in the culture of the Elbaf Giants, there might be a prophecy that the Sun God will eventually come back and calm some sort of disaster by destroying the current world order. Do you feel that? I'm getting goosebumps all over my body! – Luffy This might lead many individuals to believe that they are the Sun God and the one responsible for calming the impending disaster. Naturally, fans know that neither of the Giants is actually the Sun God. This is simply down to the fact that the Sun God is actually none other than Luffy, the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and the protagonist of the series. Luffy has the power of the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, and he has already liberated many countries, just as the Sun God Nika did in the tales and myths. Obviously, there cannot be two Sun Gods, which is why Loki is heavily misinformed and his idea of being the Sun God is certainly not the right one. Oda just dropped the updated bounties of two legendary pirates. These two characters are more than worthy of such high bounties. For him to declare this to Luffy's face, however, is very interesting. If Loki finds out about Luffy being the Sun God, then, there will clearly be a battle between these two. Luffy, of course, does not care about claiming himself as the Sun God. But Loki might take it as a challenge and would want to fight Luffy, especially because Luffy is so strong. This might lead one to believe that Loki would test his skill against the person called the Sun God, and it will surely be more than just impressive.  The relationship between Loki and Luffy is certainly going to be an interesting one. It is impossible to exactly predict the way it will go. But, at this point in time, it looks like this relationship will start as hostile. But, that doesn't necessarily mean that they will stay hostile throughout the entirety of Elbaf. Right now, Loki is being called the Disgraced Prince. He's openly called problematic and the entirety of Elbaf is essentially against him; he's painted as a villain. And, at least for a significant period of Elbaf, he might play this role. However, when Ragnarok truly does happen and Loki has to prove himself as the Sun God, fans might actually get to see him team up with Luffy against a better or greater foe. This could be the interesting turn in the story that makes Elbaf all the more interesting. For now, however, Loki and Luffy might not get along as well as one would like. Fans might get to see them fight and this battle will likely be interrupted at some point in time. For all that to happen, however, Loki has to be freed first. Perhaps, Luffy will go through the trouble of freeing him, and then, fans might see Loki challenging him to a battle. Of course, these exciting developments could happen over the course of the next few weeks, and fans absolutely cannot wait to see what happens next, when One Piece does return from its long break.  For now, fans need to keep in mind that Loki and Luffy are going to be two important figures in the Elbaf around whom the plot is going to revolve quite a bit, and that they are going to change the shape and the future of this country all together. One Piece is available to read via Viz Media. The series can be read by the fans officially and for free on the Shonen Jump and the Manga Plus app. The release date for the next chapter of One Piece, One Piece 1130, is set to be October 20, 2024.

Sanji still has a lot of room to grow in One Piece. His next genetic mutation in Elbaf will give him a huge power up. Amazon offers an excellent deal on the latest-generation Madden game for the PlayStation 5, available for a limited time at $39.99. Power Rangers fans will not have long to wait for December 10, when a highly-anticipated title launches on all major platforms. Following its long-awaited release for PC, the original Red Dead Redemption is celebrating an incredibly positive launch on the platform. Sony recently unveiled its plan — albeit a controversial one — to make way for GTA 6's release, but Microsoft's silence is cause for concern. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has limited sniper options available, but each one offers some distinct qualities that enhance them in specific situations. After nearly a year and a half of silence, Bungie releases a new development update on its upcoming live-service extraction shooter, Marathon.\n"
