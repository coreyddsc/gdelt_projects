Using the Magnolia Blossom Park lot in Willow Creek, they have managed to recreate the Western feeling perfectly, with all the buildings looking exactly as they're supposed to. Unfortunately, it doesn't give a look at the interiors of the buildings, but given their talent on show with these exteriors, Alex200496 could also do a great job with the interiors if they haven't already.\n",

Another user challenged the player to recreate Valentine fromRed Dead Redemption 2, and apparently, I’m actively working on one but I stopped at one point. Might have to continue.\" Given how well they've done with Rhodes, seeing their take on Valentine would certainly be welcomed.\n",

It's certainly a surprising development, with many feeling a sequel was inevitable after all this time. However,The Sims 4expansions continue to perform well, the next of which is set to be theLife and DeathDLC at the end of October. It remains to be seen how long players will remain engaged withThe Sims 4, although its lifespan has surely been helped by a lack of real competition.\n",
