With the end of the season rapidly approaching, Screen Rant was fortunate enough to be able to sit down with some of the English voice actors for the series, Trina Nishimura (Kyoka Jiro), Zeno Robinson (Hawks), and Jessie Grelle (Fumikage Tokoyami), to talk about their characters, their legacy with the series, and how the future looks forMy Hero Academia's characters.\n",
      "Last Paragraph: In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the \"One-For-All\" quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.\n",

      "Paragraph 4: Dan Da Danactually made it onto Netflix's top 10, something that is quite an achievement for an anime series.\n",
      "Paragraph 5: For fans of the dubbed version of the anime,Dan Da Danwill have a dub premiering the same day and time as the sub for all episodes. In addition to Japanese and English dubs, the episodes are also available in Deutsch and French.\n",
      "Paragraph 6: The episode begins with an exorcist appearing on TV, but their guesses are inaccurate. They take a taxi home, get out near their destination, and walk the rest of the way. With Turbo Granny about to attack Momo, the exorcist jumps in and burns the curse, protecting the young girl. As it turns out, this spirit medium is none other than Momo's grandmother, Seiko, and she manages to overwhelm Turbo Granny and get Okarun back in control, although he is contained inside a room that suppresses his curse.\n",
      "Paragraph 7: After Momo wakes up, she and Seiko discuss the new situation, and Momo affirms her commitment to helping Okarun. Seeing her granddaughter's determination, she explains to her and Okarun that they can exorcise Turbo Granny if they lure her out of her stronghold, where she is practically invincible, and take her elsewhere where she doesn't have a homecourt advantage. To do this, the two must train: Okarun has to improve his stamina and physicality and Momo has to unlock the full potential of her psychic powers.\n",
      "Paragraph 8: Dan Da Dan continues to make waves in the anime world, with its simulcast schedule on Netflix catapulting it into the top 10 shows of the platform.\n",
      "Paragraph 9: In a training session, Okarun has to use the bathroom, and Momo accompanies him to continue suppressing Turbo Granny. As he is using the toilet, the curse emerges and warns Momo that she will curse everyone she sees using Okarun's body to death, and if she doesn't come to the tunnel tonight, she will start a murder spree, including Seiko. Angered by the threat from Turbo Granny that she would hurt her loved ones, Momo heads to the tunnel to take her on, and Okarun accompanies her too.\n",
      "Paragraph 10: Besides sporting a visually striking character design, the anime accentuated Seiko's charming personality and made her much more likable. Her appearance was long-awaited, and the way she pulled up with a cocky attitude and destroyed Turbo Granny was nothing short of spectacular. Her moment with Momo before she heads off to the tunnel also characterizes her even more than the energetic grandmother viewers thought she was. Overall, episode #3 delivers on the appearance of the beloved character, and there is more to come from Seiko.\n",
      "Paragraph 11: Although it is much sooner than expected, a fight with Turbo Granny will take place as the two head to the tunnel to take her down before she starts killing people. Fans can expect yet another action-packed episode, hopefully, that is as good or even better than episode #1. This one will definitely be more exciting as fans will see an enraged Momo with psychic abilities fight, and in an impossible fight no less. With how beautifully animated the anime has been so far,episode #4 could be the best one so far.\n",
      "Paragraph 12: Dan Da Danis jumping back into the action after a relatively calm episode of introducing an important character and laying the foundation for Momo's eventual power-up.Turbo Granny is already an interesting antagonistwhose full abilities are unknown, so the next episode will bust out all the guns for the villain and make it an episode worth looking out for.\n",
      "Paragraph 13: Your comment has not been saved\n",
      "Paragraph 14: Two high school students, embroiled in a wager to prove the existence of ghosts or aliens, encounter daunting paranormal threats, acquire superpowers, and possibly discover love. The series blends supernatural elements with personal dynamics as the protagonists navigate their newfound abilities and unexpected challenges.\n"
