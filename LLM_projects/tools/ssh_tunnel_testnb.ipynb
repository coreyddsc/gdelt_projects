Elbaf is an arc that fans I've been waiting ages for. In fact, it is an arc that was set up in the story before even Wano was hinted at, and in many ways, this arc could potentially be even bigger. This might just be the biggest Arc inOne Piece, which means that Oda will introduce some of the most important characters here, and have others who have already been introduced in the story, such as Shanks, play a very important role.Of course, when it comes to the newly introduced characters, those from Elbaf are likely to be inspired by Norse mythology. Fans know for a fact that the Elbaf takes root deep in Norse mythology, and the many gods that fans know exist, such as Loki, will make an appearance in this story arc at some point. Recently, Oda introduced one such God to the fans, and this sets up even better things to come in the future ofOne Piece. While Elbaf has many godly inspired characters, such as Loki, none of them have actually been confirmed to be gods. Loki is simply a giant that exists in Elbaf, and he is a prince of the Kingdom. Fans do not know if Loki actually holds a godly position or is even called a God. That depends on what Oda wants to do with the story, and how he will describe the culture of Elbaf to be. Perhaps, in the Land of Elbaf, people hold important positions with the title of God, similar to Skypiea. Perhaps that is not the case, and Loki, among other Giants who are inspired by Gods, is simply a normal Giants with a lot of power. Fans do not know much about that yet. We must report this incident to the Sun God immediately! But, there is an exception. In Elbaf, there is a certain God that is worshiped by all.This is the Sun God, also known as Nika.Fans know that the tale of the Sun God Nika actually stems from the land of Elbaf, as was confirmed in the Egghead Island Arc by Vegapunk himself. Fans know for a fact that the tales of the Sun God Nika from Elbaf precede even Joy Boy, who existed 800 years ago in theOne Pieceworld. Nika existed as a legend from Elbaf, and whether this God was real or not is something that no one really knows. What fans know for a fact is that Elbaf worships Nika as a true God, and so far, this particular person is the only God that fans know exists in the land. The East Blue 5, Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji have a huge role to play in One Piece's Elbaf. Right now, fans know that the title of Sun God belongs to none other than Luffy. He ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi, and with it, gained the powers of Nika. However, recently, a new character was introduced with the title of Sun God. This character was seen in the fake Elbaf that the Straw Hat Pirates found themselves in. This character was recently revealed in One Piece chapter 1128, and it is safe to say that they are going to play an incredibly exciting role in the future of One Piece. Of course, the legitimacy of the Sun God title that this character holds is still up for debate. Given that Luffy is the Sun God, it is highly likely that this person is actually not a Sun God at all and just pretends to be the Sun God, just as they seem to love to be the ruler of a world that they create themselves.\"]\n",
